                      <p>Hyundai's Tucson crossover is the country’s best selling car,
                      according to new figures. But latest SIMI statistics
                      show that fewer cars were registered last month – 
                      overall registrations were down by 21pc to 17,128.
                      Registrations for the first two months of the year are down 8.4pc.
                      Among the other best-sellers in the tighter market were 
                      the Nissan Qashqai, Ford Focus, Skoda Octavia, Volkswagen Golf,
                      Ford Fiesta, Toyota Corolla, KIA Sportage, Toyota Yaris and Renault Megane. </p>

                    <h4>World’s Fastest Car</h4>
                    <p>Last week electric car giants Tesla held 
                    a launch event for their much anticipated all-electric ‘Semi Truck’. 
                    The new electric lorry will achieve 500 miles of range at 
                    maximum weight at 60mph and can go from zero-60mph in just five seconds, 
                    even with a max load of 80,000lbs it can accelerate to 60mph in just 20 seconds.
                    The Semi Truck also host’s advances in safety technology with motors 
                    on each wheel which alter torque and eliminates the possibility of jackknifing.
                    Drivers of the Semi Truck will sit centrally </p>

                    <h4>Nissan releases a new Car</h4>
                    <p>Nissan has a new compact crossover joining the fray in 2018, 
                    and you've probably seen it before. The Nissan Kicks went on sale last year 
                    in certain markets outside the U.S., and it'll finally come to a dealership near you
                    in June of next year (assuming you live in America). 
                    But wait – doesn't Nissan already have a compact CUV to compete with the likes of the Chevy Trax and Honda HR-V? Not anymore. 
                    The Juke is going for 2018, replaced by the significantly less polarizing Kicks.</p>
